# Image-from-Deezer-Playlist

The main goal of this script is to collect tracks from a Deezer playlist in order to create a tier list.

## Installation

- Make sure you have changed the `playlist_id` and `download_path` variables in the script.
- Don’t forget to install the required libraries for this script.

## Warning

- It may happen that some albums don't have a `cover_big`.
- I chose the font used because it supports both Japanese and French characters (which are included in my playlist). Feel free to change it to one that fits yours better.
